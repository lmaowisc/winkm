Since we only have the marginal distributions through the KM curves, we will need to infer their associations via additional summary data like total event counts and rates.\nAll in all, we need the following for each arm:\n\nKM estimates for OS and EFS (obtained by scanning and digitizing the curves using free online tools like WebPlotDigitizer;\nAt-risk table at selected time points (usually provided below the KM curves);\nTotal event counts (reported in the CONSORT diagram or results section):\n\nDeaths (OS);\nEFS endpoints (first of death/nonfatal event);\nNonfatal event."
